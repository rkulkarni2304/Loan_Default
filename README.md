I have built this kernel to explain various classification models and metrics which can be used to evaluate models. I will go through various aspects of machine learning such as data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model selection, parameter tuning and resampling. We will aim to predict the probablity of deafaulting in the next month using various data related to the customers.

This kind of task is very useful in risk management. Since banks make most of their revenues thorugh credit card bills of their customers, it's very important to have a good prediction otherwise defaulting causes huge losses to the banks.
